  heading: OUR STORY
  sub_heading_one: "4Geeks Academy was founded in 2015. However, was in 2016 when we were finally out there with 3 locations: Miami Dade College, Caracas, and Miami.  What began as an internal project to train new developers has flourished into a full-time passion. Alejandro and Marcelo, friends of many years, have not worked on the same Project until 4Geeks united both visions. The Academy was also a supervening passion for both of them. On one side, the passion for education and software (Alejandro) and on the other the passion for Tech startups (Marcelo). Today 4Geeks has +7 campus spread over the United States, Latin America and Europe. 1000+ graduates and tons of things to be proud of. The path continues to be very challenging because we are on the way to building a symbol of education in Technology."
