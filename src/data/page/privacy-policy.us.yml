  - title: "Log Files"
    text: >
      4Geeks Academy follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this as a part of hosting services' analytics. The information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.

  - title: "Cookies and Web Beacons"
    text: >
      Like many websites, 4Geeks Academy uses "cookies" to store information including visitors' preferences and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the user experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors' browser type and/or other information.

    text: |-
      What we send & why: If you provide your mobile number, we may send you service-related or informational SMS messages (e.g., enrollment updates, reminders, support notifications). Marketing messages are only sent if you explicitly agree to receive them.

      How we collect consent: Consent is obtained through our web forms, checkboxes, enrollment or event registration flows, or when you text us first. Each form clearly states that submitting your number authorizes us to send SMS messages.

      Opting out: You can opt out at any time by replying **STOP** to any message. You may receive one final message confirming your opt-out. For help, reply **HELP** or email privacy@4geeksacademy.com.

      Message & data rates: Standard message and data rates may apply, and message frequency varies.

      Carrier disclaimer: Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

  - title: "SMS Data Handling & Security"
    text: |-
      We treat phone numbers and SMS interaction data as personal information:
      - No sale or sharing: We do not sell or share your phone number with third parties for their own marketing.
      - Limited access: Only authorized personnel and service providers (e.g., SMS delivery vendors) can access this data to perform services on our behalf.
      - Secure storage: Data is stored using administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect it.
      - Retention: We keep SMS-related data only as long as needed to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with legal obligations, then delete or anonymize it.
