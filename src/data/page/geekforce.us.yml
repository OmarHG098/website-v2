        We will hold mock interviews to assess your strengths and weaknesses to create a stronger profile before the actual interviews. Every time you have an interview, we will practice using different technologies.
        We have our very own pool of auto-graded exercises, so you can practice until you master the skills to get the job you want.

        Launching a career in tech involves assessing your current situation and making informed decisions about the future.
        It requires assessment of yourself, your context, and ACTION. You can do this alone; or you can rely on a mentor's experience which can give you
        Perspective, information and access to the right resources. In 4Geeks we adjust the sessions according to your calendar,
        We also give you the opportunity to have them online or in-person.
        In any case, we assure you that you have the opportunity for constant mentoring whenever you need it.
