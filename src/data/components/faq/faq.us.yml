          Our extended payment plan allows you to spread your tuition payments over a period of up to 2 years, enabling you to pay gradually during and after the course. To enroll, a $500 deposit is required upfront, and the remaining balance is divided equally over the agreed-upon number of months, <span style="font-weight: 700;">with no interest charged</span>.<br>

        answer: |-
          We believe that the future of education is <span style="font-weight: 700;">"part-time."</span> Our approach is a blended education that leverages two proven formats: part-time training and flipped classroom. This methodology combines the following four pillars:<br><br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Flipped Classroom:</span> The theory is taught through videos, animation, images, and infographics. Class time is used to discuss, create and build projects, and to be mentored in solving practical exercises.<br><br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Personalized Mentoring:</span> Each student has the opportunity to have private conversations with a lead mentor on a regular basis.<br><br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Mentor-Student Ratio 1:7 (on average):</span> A close and personalized environment allows our academy to adapt to the particular pace of each student.<br><br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Talent Tree:</span> The curriculum charts 44 skills in which students earn points for each skill learned in a playful way.<br><br>

          Python is the fastest growing language in the wealthiest countries. It is widely used in virtually every industry and has top-quality libraries for all fields, growing to be "the future" in areas like Web, AI, Robotics, Big Data, and more. According to MIT Professors, it is the essential programming language to learn. Go ahead and take a look for yourself <a class="faq-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>. Python is the way to go. It offers more job opportunities, helps you learn to code, and supports you with other back-end languages and frameworks. Even Google endorses Python and has incorporated it everywhere!

      - question: "Why not Node JS?"
        templates: ["faq"]
        priority: 0
        answer: |
          Node.js is indeed an impressive technology, challenging the traditional approach to web development. However, only a small fraction, about 0.3%, of the web has adopted Node.js, and its growth rate has slowed in recent months. Meanwhile, languages like Python, Java, and PHP continue to dominate the industry and are unlikely to change anytime soon. These languages operate differently from Node.js, and our goal is to prepare you for the 'real world' by teaching the most standard and professional technologies. You can find a detailed argument explaining our decision not to teach Node.js in our Full-Stack Development Program <a class="faq-link" href="/us/trends-and-tech/dont-teach-nodejs-full-stack-development-program">here</a>.

      - question: "Do I graduate as a 'Senior Developer?"
        templates: ["faq"]
        priority: 0
        answer: |
          No, graduating from any Bootcamp does not automatically make you a 'Senior'. The title of 'Senior' typically comes with years of experience in the field. However, our bootcamp is designed to equip you with the necessary skills and knowledge to start your career as a 'Junior Developer' and with the dedication and continuous learning, you can work your way up to a senior position.

        answer: |
          According to estimations by the IDB between 2020 and 2025, there will be a need for 10.5 million professionals in the tech industry worldwide. Currently, there are over 1.4 million job openings for programmers in the United States, and this number is expected to increase by 2021. In Spain, during the pandemic, 1,500 job openings for programming were created on a single job search platform. On the other hand, in Latin America, around 1.2 million tech professionals will be needed to help reduce the gap. Therefore, the market for companies seeking to hire programmers is going to continue to grow at a rapid pace to keep up with the large demand.
