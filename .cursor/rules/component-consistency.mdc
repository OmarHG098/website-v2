# Rule: Component Consistency and Scalability

**Purpose:**
Ensure all components in the 4Geeks project are consistent in data handling, styling, multilingual support, accessibility, and scalability. This rule standardizes how components fetch/display dynamic data, enforce design, handle translations, and support accessibility, making it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.

---

## How to Use This Rule
- **Read before creating or updating any component.**
- **Follow the structure and examples below.**
- **Propose updates via pull request and get team approval.**
- **All changes must pass `npm run test` to ensure nothing breaks.**

---

## 1. Purpose
Standardize component structure and behavior for maintainability, scalability, and a cohesive user experience across the project.

---

## 2. Scope
- All files in `/src/components/` and related data in `/src/data/components/`.
- Any shared utilities/hooks for data, translations, or state management.

---

## 3. Guidelines

### Data Fetching & Static Data
- **Fetch dynamic data using GraphQL queries directly inside the component file, as in `Staff`.**
- **Store static data in `.yml` files in `/src/data/components/`, following the `Staff` format (e.g., name, role, image, contact).**
- **Do not use extra data fetchers or external data files for component data.**
- **Example:**
    - ✅ `useStaticQuery` with a GraphQL query in the component file.
    - ❌ Fetching data from external JS/TS files or APIs for static content.

### Styling & Features
- **Match the styling (typography, colors, layout) and features of the `Staff` component.**
- **Use horizontal swipeable carousels for lists, as in `Staff` (e.g., with the Carousel component).**
- **Use Styled Components and project design tokens for all styling.**
- **Do not use inline styles except for dynamic values.**
- **Example:**
    - ✅ `<Div color={Colors.primary}>` and `<Carousel ...>`
    - ❌ `<div style={{ color: 'red' }}>`

### Language-Based Rendering
- **Show components and data based on the selected language (English/Spanish), using the same setup as `Staff`.**
- **Use language from context or props, and filter data by language key in `.yml` files.**
- **Use the same keys in both language files.**
- **Example:**
    - ✅ `data.edges.find(({ node }) => node.fields.lang === lang)`
    - ❌ Showing only English or Spanish regardless of user selection.

### Reusable Query Hooks
- **Use or create reusable query hooks in `/utils` or `/hooks` for common data fetching patterns, as in `Staff`.**
- **Document new hooks/utilities in the codebase.**
- **Example:**
    - ✅ `const { t } = useTranslation();`
    - ❌ Duplicating translation logic in each component.

### Accessibility
- **Follow accessibility practices as in `Staff`:**
    - All interactive elements must have ARIA labels and support keyboard navigation.
    - Use semantic HTML and test with screen readers.
- **Example:**
    - ✅ `<button aria-label="Close">`
    - ❌ `<div onClick={...}>` without keyboard support.

### Modularity & Reusability
- **Each component must be modular and reusable, following the structure of `Staff` for easy future additions.**
- **Each component in its own folder, main file as `index.js`.**
- **Follow naming conventions: lowercase, hyphen-separated for folders.**
- **Document any exceptions in the component folder.**

### Gatsby Node Integration (Critical!)
- **Whenever you add a new YAML type/component (e.g., `AdmissionsStaffYaml`), you MUST update `gatsby-node.js` to add the new type to the list in `onCreateNode` so that `fields.lang` and related fields are created.**
- **If this is not done, GraphQL queries for language-based filtering will fail, causing hard-to-debug build errors.**
- **This step is mandatory for all new YAML-driven components.**

### YAML File Requirements
- **Every component that uses YAML data must have both an English (`us`) and Spanish (`es`) YAML file, even if only one language is used.**
- **YAML filenames must be all lowercase and use underscores (`_`) for multi-word names (e.g., `admissions_staff.us.yml`, `admissions_staff.es.yml`).**
- **This ensures future-proofing and prevents missing translation or build errors.**

---

## 4. Examples
- `/src/components/Staff/index.js` (fetches staff data with GraphQL, renders by language, uses styled components, accessible carousel)
- `/src/components/AdmissionsStaff/index.js` (static data, language-based rendering, Staff-style layout)

---

## 5. Enforcement
- **Tools:**
    - Linters for folder/file naming and accessibility.
    - Code review for data, styling, and translation compliance.
    - CI checks and tests (`npm run test`).
    - Custom scripts for translation key consistency.

---

## 6. Versioning
- **Version:** v1.2, 2024-06-10
- **Update the version and date when making changes to this rule.**

---

**Note:**
- Link this file in the README or contributing guide for team visibility.
- Review this rule regularly to keep it relevant and up to date.
- **Failure to follow the Gatsby Node integration and YAML file requirements can result in time-consuming, preventable errors during build and deployment.**
