# Rule: Landing A Creation Workflow
Type: Workspace Rule
Description: AI-assisted workflow for creating new landing_a template pages iteratively with component-by-component additions.

## Introduction

This workflow is designed for **creating new landing pages** with AI assistance in an iterative, controlled manner. It allows you to:
- Start with a minimal functional foundation
- Add components one at a time with custom content
- Review and refine each addition before proceeding
- Test the capability to quickly add/modify components

**When to use this workflow:**
- Creating new landing pages from scratch
- Testing rapid component additions with text changes
- Building landing pages with specific, customized content
- Learning the landing_a template structure

**Related rule:** See `landing-a-template` for complete component reference and property details.

## Component Tiers

Understanding the different levels of component sets helps you start with the right foundation:

### Tier 1: Absolute Minimum (4 Components)
**Purpose:** Structure testing and YAML parsing only
**Components:**
- `meta_info` - Page metadata and configuration
- `navbar` - Navigation bar
- `form` - Lead capture form
- `header_data` - Hero section/jumbotron
- `features` - Value propositions displayed under header
- `follow_bar` - Sticky CTA bar (top/bottom)

**Use when:** Testing YAML structure or building proof-of-concept only
**Note:** ⚠️ NOT sufficient for a real landing page

### Tier 2: Functional Minimum (6-7 Components)
**Purpose:** Real landing pages with complete user experience
**Components:**
- All 6 from Tier 1, plus:
- `short_badges` - Credibility indicators (awards, certifications)

**Use when:** Creating production landing pages
**Note:** ✅ This is the recommended starting point for real landing pages

### Tier 3: Full Featured Landing
**Purpose:** Complete landing page with all sections
**Additional Components:** Any combination of:
- Standalone: `program_details`, `rating_reviews`, `geeks_vs_others`, `why_4geeks`, `who_is_hiring`, etc.
- Dynamic: Two-column layouts, iconograms, testimonials, job guarantee, financing options, etc.

**Use when:** Building comprehensive marketing landing pages

## Iterative Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Initialize with Functional Minimum

Start by creating a new `.us.yml` file with the 6-7 core components:

```yaml
meta_info:
  slug: descriptive-landing-name
  title: "SEO-optimized title (50-60 chars)"
  description: "SEO meta description (150-160 chars)" # ⚠️ MUST be unique across all landing pages
  visibility: "hidden" # Start hidden, change to visible when ready
  template: "landing_a"
  utm_course: ["course-name"]
  utm_location: ["location-slug"]
  # ... other meta_info fields

navbar:
  buttonText: "CTA Text"
  buttonUrl: "#leadform_header"

form:
  fields: ["full_name", "phone", "email"]
  heading: "Form heading"
  motivation: "Form subtitle/motivation"
  button_label: "SUBMIT BUTTON"

apply_schollarship:
  imageSide: "left"
  image: "../../../static/images/landing/image.webp"

header_data:
  background: "#ffffff"
  tagline: "Main headline"
  tagline_color: "#1c1c1c"
  form_styles:
    background: "#0084FF"
    color: "white"
    button:
      background: "black"

features:
  marginTop: 0px
  styles: '{ "fontSize": "20px", "margin": "10px 0px 0px 0px" }'
  bullets:
    - "First value proposition"
    - "Second value proposition"
    - "Third value proposition"

short_badges:
  - name: "Badge Name"
    url: ""
    image: "../../../static/images/badges/badge.png"
    alt: "Badge description"

follow_bar:
  position: "top"
  content:
    text: "Desktop message"
    text_mobile: "Mobile message"
    font_size: ["25px", "25px", "25px", "20px", "18px"]
  button:
    text: "CTA Button"
    path: "#leadform_header"
```

### Step 2: Iterative Component Addition

Once the base is ready, add components iteratively:

**User provides instruction:**
```
"Add 'program_details' with this sub_heading: 'Custom text here'"
```

**AI adds component:**
- Identifies if standalone or dynamic component
- Places standalone components ABOVE `components` section
- Places dynamic components INSIDE `components` section
- Uses next available odd position number (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.)
- Applies custom text as specified

**User reviews:**
- Approves and moves to next component, OR
- Requests refinements to the newly added component

**Repeat** until landing page is complete

### Step 3: Review and Finalize

Before marking as complete:
- [ ] Test all responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Verify YAML syntax (no curly quotes!)
- [ ] Confirm position numbers are odd with gaps
- [ ] Check standalone components are above `components` section
- [ ] **Verify `meta_info.description` is unique** - Run `npm run test` to check for duplicate descriptions
- [ ] Update visibility to "visible" when ready to publish

## Component Addition Process

### Adding Standalone Components

Standalone components go ABOVE the `components` section:

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT
program_details:
  position: 3
  heading: "Section heading"
  sub_heading: "Section subtitle"

rating_reviews:
  position: 7
  heading: "Reviews heading"
  
components:
  - name: first_component
    position: 1
```

**Common standalone components:**
- `program_details`
- `rating_reviews`
- `geeks_vs_others`
- `why_4geeks`
- `who_is_hiring`
- `badges`
- `alumni_projects`

### Adding Dynamic Components

Dynamic components go INSIDE the `components` section:

```yaml
components:
  - name: why-choose-4geeks
    position: 1
    layout: two_column_right
    proportions: [6, 6]
    heading:
      text: "Custom heading text"
    # ... other properties
    
  - name: iconogram-section
    position: 5
    layout: iconogram
    icons:
      - icon: "graduation-2"
        title: "Icon title"
        content: "Icon description"
```

**Common dynamic layouts:**
- `two_column_left` / `two_column_right`
- `iconogram`
- `job_guarantee_small`
- `testimonials_new`
- `faq`

### Position Number Strategy

Always use odd numbers with gaps:

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Easy to insert new components between existing ones
position: 1   # First component
position: 3   # Can add position 2 if needed later
position: 5   # Can add position 4 if needed later
position: 7   # Plenty of room for future additions

# ❌ BAD: Hard to reorder without changing many numbers
position: 1
position: 2
position: 3
position: 4
```

## Best Practices

### YAML Syntax Rules

1. **Always use straight quotes** (`"` and `'`), never curly quotes (`"`, `"`, `'`, `'`)
   ```yaml
   ✅ text: "We've got the best bootcamp"
   ❌ text: "We've got the best bootcamp"
   ```

2. **Style objects use single quotes** with JSON inside
   ```yaml
   ✅ style: '{ "fontSize": "20px", "color": "#000" }'
   ❌ style: "{ fontSize: 20px, color: #000 }"
   ```

3. **Maintain YAML structure order:**
   - Required components first
   - Recommended components second
   - Standalone components third
   - `components` section last

### Component Ordering

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT ORDER
meta_info:
navbar:
form:
header_data:
features:
short_badges:
follow_bar:

# Standalone components
program_details:
rating_reviews:
why_4geeks:

# Components section (always last)
components:
  - name: component_one
  - name: component_two
```

### Incremental Testing

After adding each component:
1. Verify YAML syntax is valid
2. Check no curly quotes were introduced
3. Confirm component is in correct section (standalone vs dynamic)
4. Test position number is odd and doesn't conflict

### SEO and Uniqueness Verification

**CRITICAL:** The `meta_info.description` field must be unique across all landing pages. Duplicate descriptions will cause test failures.

**Verification Steps:**
1. **When creating initial meta_info:** Write a unique description that reflects the specific landing page content
2. **Before finalizing:** Run `npm run test` to check for duplicate descriptions
3. **If duplicate found:** Update the description to be unique while maintaining SEO best practices (150-160 characters)

**Example of unique descriptions:**
```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Unique, specific descriptions
description: "Launch your tech career with our AI-powered full stack bootcamp. Master AI-integrated skills in 12 weeks"
description: "Start your mornings coding with our accelerated AI-powered full stack bootcamp. Master AI-integrated skills in 12 weeks with morning-focused training"

# ❌ BAD: Duplicate descriptions (will fail tests)
description: "Launch your tech career with our AI-powered full stack bootcamp. Master AI-integrated skills in 12 weeks"
description: "Launch your tech career with our AI-powered full stack bootcamp. Master AI-integrated skills in 12 weeks"
```

**Why this matters:**
- SEO: Search engines penalize duplicate meta descriptions
- Test suite: The project's test suite (`test.seo.js`) validates uniqueness and will fail if duplicates exist
- User experience: Unique descriptions help users understand what makes each landing page different

### Text Customization

When adding components with custom text:
- Replace only the text content, keep structure intact
- Maintain responsive font size arrays: `["40px", "34px", "30px", "25px", "20px"]`
- Preserve style objects and formatting
- Keep icons, colors, and layout properties from template

## Common Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Basic Landing Page
```
User: Create data-science-beginners.us.yml with functional minimum
AI: Creates file with 6 core components

User: Add 'program_details' with heading "What You'll Learn"
AI: Adds standalone component at position 3

User: Add 'why-choose-4geeks' component with custom bullets
AI: Adds dynamic component at position 1

User: Add 'job_guarantee_small'
AI: Adds dynamic component at position 5
```

### Example 2: Comprehensive Landing
```
User: Start with functional minimum
AI: Creates base with 6-7 components

User: Add iconogram, rating_reviews, geeks_vs_others
AI: Adds all three at positions 3, 5, 7

User: Add Rigobot section and financing options
AI: Adds dynamic components at positions 9, 11

User: Add who_is_hiring
AI: Adds standalone component at position 13
```
